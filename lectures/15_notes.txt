15.1 DBSCAN Motivation 
k-means's decision boundary is linear, it cannot identify complex cluster shapes.

15.2 DBSCAN - density based clustering
two hyper params
1.eps: determines what it means for points to be close (low eps = more noise points, higher eps = more accepting)
2.min_samples: determines the number of neighbouring points we require to consider in order for a point to be part of a cluster. 

~ we cannot use elbow method to examine the goodness of clusters created with DBSCAN
~ but silutte method could
