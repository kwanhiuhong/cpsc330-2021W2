ColumnTransformer

6.2 - Encoding Text Features
~ What if the features are in the form of raw text? (E.g. "I am happy")

1. Bags of words representation: 
	~ most popular
	~ ignores the syntax and word order
	~ two components:
		a. the vocabulary (all unique words in all documents, a document is a *row* data, or a feature containing text in the row)
		b. a value indicating either the presence or absence or the count of each word in the document
	~ you can use "CountVectorizer().fit_transform()" to do the work, but each time you can only convert one single feature at once. (You gotta input a pandas.series or array into the function)
