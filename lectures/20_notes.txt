Statistical parity suggests that the proportion of each segment of a protected class (e.g. sex) should receive the positive outcome at equal rates. For example, the number of loans approved for female should be equal to male.

Equal opportunity suggests that each group should get the positive outcome at equal rates, assuming that people in this group qualify for it. For example, if a man and a woman have both a certain level of income, we want them to have the same chance of getting the loan. In other words, the true positive rate (TPR or recall) of both groups should be equal.

There is usually a tradeoff between rationality (adopting effective means to achieve your desired outcome) and bias. The desired outcome of banks, for example, is to maximize their profit. So in many circumstances, they not only care about approving as many qualified applications as possible (true positive), but also to avoid approving unqualified applications (false postive) because default loan could have detrimental effects for them.
