7.1 Linear Regression
We use Ridge instead of LinearRegression() in scikit learn because we could adjust the alpga - hyperparameter in Ridge()

7.2 Logistics Regression
The decision boundary of logistics regression is a hyperplane dividing the feature space in half.

If you have d features, then your decision boundary will be d-1 dimensional hyperplane

7.3 Predicting Probability Scores
probabilities will be higher if the point is far away from the decision boundary in the case of logistics regression.
